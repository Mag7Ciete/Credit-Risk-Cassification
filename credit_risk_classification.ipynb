    "**Answer:** The logistic regression model fitted with oversampled data performs quite well in predicting both the \"0\" (healthy loan) and \"1\" (high-risk loan) labels. The classification report shows high precision, recall, and F1-score for both classes. Specifically, for the high-risk loan class (1), the model achieves a high precision of 0.84, indicating that when it predicts a high-risk loan, it's correct 84% of the time. The recall for this class is also high at 0.99, indicating that the model is capturing 99% of the actual high-risk loans. Overall, the model demonstrates strong predictive performance for both classes, making it effective at identifying high-risk loans while maintaining accuracy for healthy loans as well."

    "        Recall: The resampled model significantly outperformed the original model in terms of recall for high-risk loans. The original model achieved\n",
    "            a recall of 0.91, while the resampled model achieved a remarkable recall of 0.99. This indicates that the resampled model can effectively \n",
    "            identify almost all actual high-risk loans.\n",
    "    Given the excellent accuracy, precision, and recall scores achieved by both models, it is recommended that the company use the resampled logistic \n",
